Backend - API Development Assignment
Internship Coding Challenge – Track 2: Backend (API + Database)
1. Scenario
You are part of a backend team tasked with building the Task Management API for an internal
company dashboard.
Frontend developers will later use your API to power their applica>on (like the one from Track 1).
Your job is to design and implement RESTful APIs for managing Employees and Tasks.
The system should allow:
• Crea>ng and lis>ng employees
• Crea>ng, upda>ng, and retrieving tasks
• Linking tasks to employees
• Filtering tasks by status or employee
You can use any backend language/framework (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Java/Spring Boot,
etc.).

2. Expected Outcome
A fully functional REST API that performs CRUD operations on:
• Employees
• Tasks

3. Deliverables
Please submit:
1. A GitHub repository with:
o API Source code
o Database schema or migra>on script
o Sample data (SQL/JSON)
2. A README.md that includes:
o Setup and run instruc>ons
o API endpoints list (with request & response examples)
o Tech stack used
o Any assump>ons made

4. Instructions
•
•
•
•
•
•

Use proper REST API standards (e.g., GET /tasks, POST /employees).
Handle validation and error responses correctly.
Use clear models/entities for Employee and Task
Include at least one level of relationship (e.g., Employee ↔ Task)
Implement basic logging and use appropriate HTTP status codes
Write modular, readable code (split routes, models, config, etc.)

5. Focus Areas (Evaluation Criteria)
Area

What we look for
Clean, logical, RESTful endpoints
Readable, modular, error handling, consistent naming
Proper schema, rela>onships, normaliza>on
Input valida>on and handling of bad requests
Clear instruc>ons and endpoint details
Basic endpoint tes>ng (Postman collec>on or script)

API Design
Code Quality
Database Design
Data Valida>on
Documenta>on
Tes>ng

6. Bonus Challenge (Optional)
Add authenGcaGon (simple JWT or API key-based) and allow:
•
•

Only authen>cated users to create/update tasks
Anyone to view tasks (public endpoint)

This demonstrates your understanding of real-world API security concepts.

7. Estimated Time
4 to 6 hours (depending on framework familiarity).

8. Example Schema
Employees Table:
Field
Id
Name
Role
Email

Type
INT(PK)
VARCHAR
